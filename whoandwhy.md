Committee note: The “Audience” section helps the program committee get a sense of whether your talk is geared more at novices or experienced individuals in a given subject.

# Who and Why

This talk is geared towards anyone that wishes to make their test suite more effective. Pseudo-tested methods are an issue that could be found in many systems, both large and small scale. It is important that people that have been programming for many years understand that they may be writing test cases that are not testing their systems as well as they intended. It is also very important that people who are just beginning to enter the world of Computer Science understand that testing is one of the most important parts of the development cycle. Teaching them to avoid practices that could lead to pseudo-tested methods could produce more stable systems in the future.

There does not need to be much background knowledge to understand this talk. The audience member would need to understand python at a base level, need to understand unit testing, and have an idea of the importance of testing. It is expected that people will learn from the talk that pseudo-tested methods are a very present part of the field of Computer Science. The portion of the audience that are beginners will take away that in testing their systems they need to ensure that their tests are also correct, or their systems will not be testing the behaviors correctly.
