I have spoken in the Education Summit at the Pycon Cleveland 2018. During my College Education, I have also been asked to give many presentations to my peers, and I was a speaker at my high school graduation. When it comes to my experience with the subject matter, I have chosen this topic as my Senior Thesis, therefore I have researched the topic of pseudo-tested methods extensively. Also I have created the tool for Automatic Detection.
