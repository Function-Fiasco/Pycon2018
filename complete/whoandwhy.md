Committee note: The “Audience” section helps the program committee get a sense of whether your talk is geared more at novices or experienced individuals in a given subject. (We need a balance of both lower-level and advanced talks to make a great PyCon!) It also helps us evaluate the relevance of your talk to the Python community. -->

This talk is geared towards anyone that wishes to make their test suite more effective. Pseudo-tested methods are an issue that could be found in many systems, both large and small scale. It is important that people who have been programming for many years understand that they may be writing test cases that are not testing their systems as well as intended. It is also very important that people who are just beginning to enter the world of Computer Science understand that testing is one of the most important parts of the development cycle. Teaching them to avoid practices that could lead to pseudo-tested methods will produce more stable systems in the future.

Minimal background knowledge is required to follow this talk. The audience member would need to understand python at a base level, unit testing and Pytest, and the importance of testing. It is expected that people will learn from the talk that pseudo-tested methods are a very present part of the field of Computer Science. Beginners as well as more experienced programmers in the audience will gain a better understanding that in testing their systems, they need to ensure that their tests are effective, or their systems will not be testing behaviors correctly.
