<!-- The “outline” is a skeleton of your talk that is as detailed as possible, including rough timings or estimates for different sections. If requesting a 45 minute slot, please describe what content would appear in the 45 minute version but not a 30 minute version, either within the outline or in a paragraph at the end.

Please do not include any personally identifiable information. The initial round of reviews are annonymous, and this field will visible to reviewers.

Committee note: The outline is extremely important for the program committee to understand what the content and structure of your talk will be. The timings/percentages help us compare multiple talks that might have a similar abstract. We know that they are estimates and only capture your view at this moment in time and are likely to change before PyCon. We hope that writing the outline is helpful to you as well, to organize and clarify your thoughts for your talk! The outline will not be shared with conference attendees. -->
